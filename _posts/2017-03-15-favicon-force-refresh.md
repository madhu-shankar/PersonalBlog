## Browser loading old favicon from cache?

Has it happened to you that you creating a website and you tried updating the favicon to a more tendy one, but it's not showing up in your browser. Well it happened to me, so I thought of sharing the solution.

Browsers locally cache some contents like images and other files on your first visit to a website. In order to force the browser to invalidate cache and load new content we can use _**Ctrl + Shift + R**_. This reloads the page without using the local cache, retrieving everything from the server.

If this also does not work, try visiting to http://yoursite.com/favion.ico (change the extension if you have used something else).
