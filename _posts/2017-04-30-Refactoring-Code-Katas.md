### Refactoring Code Katas

Recently I have been reading about Refactoting fundamentals. It feels good to know about best practices of writing maintainble code. But just reading doesn't make me remember things and use them in my work. As I read, I try to apply it in my work, but you can't apply everything in your work at once. So I was looking for any exercises on Reafctoring in the internet and I found few really good Code Katas which I can pratice to apply most of the Reafctoring techniques. I am sharing the links to those code katas in this blog post.

1.[Tennis Score Display Code Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata)

2.[Gilded Rose Code Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

3.[Yatzy Game Code Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/Yatzy-Refactoring-Kata)

Among these code katas, GildedRose is one I have most heard of. These Katas have small code base and are really thought provoking. I will be solving each of these and I will try share all the thigs I learn while solving these. Do let me know in the comments if you know of any other great code kata..
